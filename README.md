# DG-EN-corpus


THE WORK PROGRESS INCLUDES THE USAGE OF ADVANCED NMT MODELS BASED ON OpenNMT-PY WHICH IS THE PYTORCH VERSION OF OPENNMT https://opennmt.net/OpenNMT-py/ AS WELL AS THE MOSES TOOLKIT FROM http://www2.statmt.org/moses/ TO WORK WITH STATISTICAL MACHINE TRANSLATION MODEL.
I hope my contributions will attract people of the Machine Translation community to reach out to similar low-resourced languages while providing necessary informations and possible contributions towards our work and join this little community and share novel ideas and datas.

THIS is the first attempt on providing limited access to manually generated dataset of a very low resourced Digaru language for tasks specific only to Machine Translation Community.
The time and effort put by the translators of this language has hence restricted the datas to be open-accessed. However, with valid reasons and request the dataset can be shared with the requesters only through shared google drive folders. 
Please send request to gain access of the datas in this repository in apnit548@gmail.com.

#request maybe granted subject to the use-case of the datas meaning for collaboration or effective presentation of its applications by third-party.
